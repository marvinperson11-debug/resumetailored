# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

ResumeTailored AI is a SaaS product that uses Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6) to tailor resumes and generate cover letters from job postings. It charges **$19.99/month** (or $129 lifetime) via Stripe. The **free tier is unlimited** — unlimited resume tailoring, cover letters, ATS scans, and LinkedIn optimizations — differentiated from Pro by a small watermark on exports and a limited template set. Tailoring requires a (free) signed-in account.

### Free vs Pro (2026 structure)

| | Free | Pro ($19.99/mo or $129 lifetime) |
|---|---|---|
| Resume tailoring + cover letters | ✅ unlimited (login required, IP rate-limited) | ✅ unlimited |
| ATS scanner, LinkedIn optimizer, LinkedIn import | ✅ | ✅ |
| Templates | 6 basic (3 resume: Classic `r1`, Executive `r5`, Minimal `r17`; 3 cover: Formal `c1`, Bold `c5`, Clean `c17`) | all 104 |
| Export watermark | small footer mark on PDF/DOCX/TXT | ✅ watermark-free |
| Resume video, personal website | ❌ Pro-only | ✅ |

Template gating is enforced **server-side** in `/api/download-docx` by the free-template `(layout + primary color)` signature — see `FREE_TPL_SIGS` / `isFreeTemplateMeta` in `server.js`. The client picker (`OUT_TPLS` in `public/app.html`, `free:true` flags) mirrors it. Keep the two in sync when changing the free set.

## Commands

```bash
npm install       # install dependencies
npm run dev       # run with nodemon (auto-restarts on file changes)
npm start         # run without nodemon (production)
```

There are no tests and no linter configured.

## Architecture

Everything lives in two places:

- **`server.js`** — the entire backend: Express app, all API routes, Stripe webhooks, Claude API calls, auth, file parsing, and .docx generation.
- **`public/`** — static frontend: `index.html` (landing page), `app.html` (main dashboard SPA), `style.css`, and post-payment pages.
- **`remotion/`** — the only TypeScript/React in the repo: a self-contained [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/docs) project that renders a tailored resume into a short MP4 (see "Resume video" below).

There is no build step for the web app. The frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS with no framework. `app.html` is a single-page app where tabs are shown/hidden via `showTab()` without any routing. Remotion is the one exception — it has its own TSX compositions, compiled on demand by Remotion's own bundler (not by the web app).

## Resume video (Remotion)

A tailored resume can be turned into a short vertical MP4 (1080×1920, ~18s) for sharing on LinkedIn / Shorts / Reels. This is the only React/TypeScript in the codebase.

- **`remotion/`** — the Remotion project:
  - `index.ts` → `registerRoot`; `Root.tsx` declares the single `ResumeVideo` composition (duration derived from highlight count via `calculateMetadata`).
  - `ResumeVideo.tsx` + `scenes/` (`Background`, `Intro`, `Highlights`, `Skills`, `Outro`) — the animated scenes.
  - `data.js` — **CommonJS** single source of truth for default props + scene timing (`sceneFrames`), shared by both the TSX (via webpack CJS interop) and the Node server. `types.ts` holds only the `ResumeVideoProps` type.
  - `parseResume.js` — converts the plain-text tailor output into `ResumeVideoProps` (name, title, summary, top-5 highlights preferring quantified bullets, skills).
  - `render.js` — server-side renderer: `bundle()` once (cached) + `selectComposition()` + `renderMedia()`. Uses Remotion's own **chrome-headless-shell** (downloaded via `ensureBrowser()`, pre-fetched at build in the `Dockerfile`); it does **not** auto-detect a system Chromium, because recent Chromium builds removed the old headless mode Remotion needs ("Old Headless mode has been removed from the Chrome binary"). The build runs on a **Debian `Dockerfile`** (not Nixpacks) because the prebuilt headless shell can't link against Nixpacks' library paths (it failed to launch with "Closed with 127"); the Dockerfile apt-installs the shell's runtime libs + fonts. An explicit `REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE`/`CHROME_PATH` overrides, but only point it at a binary that still supports old headless.
  - `narration.js` — voiceover for the MP4. `generateNarrationAsync` tries, in order: **ElevenLabs** (studio-quality, when `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set — uses the `/with-timestamps` endpoint for an mp3 + exact duration), then the local engine **Piper** (natural neural voice; Piper binary via `PIPER_BIN`/PATH/`python3 -m piper` + a voice model resolved from `PIPER_VOICE`/common dirs or best-effort downloaded), then **espeak-ng** (robotic), else silent. **All three engines are gender-aware:** the voice the user picks (ElevenLabs catalog key, or an explicit `voiceGender`) selects a matching local voice too — Piper uses `en_US-ryan-high` (male) / `en_US-lessac-medium` (female) and espeak uses `en-us+m3` / `en-us+f3` — so a male pick is never rendered in the female fallback voice (env-overridable via `PIPER_VOICE_ID_MALE`/`_FEMALE`, `ESPEAK_VOICE_MALE`/`_FEMALE`). **The pipeline is also language-aware:** `parseResume` auto-detects a predominantly-Chinese resume (CJK share > 25%) and sets `props.lang = 'zh'`, which switches the narration connectives + outro presets to Chinese (`data.js`), the on-screen greeting to 您好, and the local voices to Chinese — Piper `zh_CN-huayan-medium` (the one standard zh voice, used for both genders; `PIPER_VOICE_ID_ZH`/`_ZH_MALE` override) and espeak `cmn+m3`/`cmn+f3` (`ESPEAK_VOICE_ZH`/`_ZH_MALE`); ElevenLabs needs no switch (`eleven_multilingual_v2` speaks the Chinese script natively). Chinese section headers (个人简介/工作经历/专业技能/教育背景 …) normalise onto the English section keys in `parseResume`. The script comes from `narrationScript` in `data.js`. The `Dockerfile` installs Piper + the `en_US-lessac-medium` (female), `en_US-ryan-high` (male), and `zh_CN-huayan-medium` (Chinese) voices on Railway (guarded with `|| true`). The composition muxes the audio via `<Audio>` and extends to fit (`audioDurationInFrames`). The `/api/resume-video` route gates ElevenLabs to **subscribers** by default (`ELEVENLABS_FREE_TIER=on` opens it to all); `RESUME_VIDEO_VOICE=off` disables voice. Best-effort throughout: any failure ⇒ silent video, and the route retries silently if an audio render fails.
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/resume-video` (`server.js`) takes `{ resume, name?, accentColor?, email }`, **Pro-only** — non-subscribers get a `402 pro_only`. It renders one video at a time (`videoRenderInFlight` lock → 429 if busy), streams the MP4, and deletes the temp file. The heavy Remotion packages are `require()`d lazily inside the handler, so the server boots even if they aren't installed (route returns 501).
- **Frontend**: a "🎬 Resume Video" button in `renderPreviewDownloadButtons()` (`app.html`, hidden for cover-letter-only mode) calls `downloadVideo()`.
- **Web preview (no server render)**: `public/preview.html` (served at `/preview`) plays the composition live in the browser via [`@remotion/player`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/player), loaded from esm.sh with React pinned through an import map — so it works on static hosting (Netlify deploy previews, mobile) with no Chromium. Supports **upload (PDF/DOCX/TXT, parsed client-side)** or paste, plus a voiceover synced to the player: a free **device voice** (Web Speech API, with a voice picker) or a **pro voice via ElevenLabs** (browser-direct — the user pastes their own API key, kept only in `localStorage` and sent only to ElevenLabs; no server key involved). Its scenes/parser/narration **mirror** the TSX + `data.js` in `remotion/` (kept deliberately in sync); the server-rendered MP4 remains the source of truth.
- **Local dev**: `npm run remotion:studio` (live preview/editor) and `npm run remotion:render` (CLI render to `out/`).
- **Deploy**: rendering needs Chrome's runtime libraries + fonts. The `Dockerfile` apt-installs the chrome-headless-shell deps (`libnss3`, `libatk1.0-0`, `libgbm-dev`, `libasound2`, …), `fontconfig`, and `fonts-dejavu-core`, then pre-downloads the shell via `ensureBrowser()`. Rendering is CPU-heavy — keep the one-at-a-time lock.

## Persistent state (SQLite)

All server state is stored in a **SQLite database** (`better-sqlite3`) created in `server.js`. The DB file lives at `${DATA_DIR}/resumetailor.db` (`DATA_DIR` defaults to `./data`). For persistence across Railway deploys, set `DATA_DIR=/data` and mount a Railway Volume at `/data`; otherwise the DB is recreated in the ephemeral container on each deploy. WAL journaling is enabled.

Tables (all created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` at startup):

| Table | What it tracks |
|---|---|
| `usage_store` | Per-feature usage counts, keyed by `${ip}_${date}_${type}` (`count`). Since the 2026 change, resume/cover/ATS/LinkedIn are unlimited and no longer written here; still used for `translate` (1/day) and `video`. |
| `subscribers` | Active Stripe subscribers (`email` PK, `customer_id`) |
| `users` | User accounts (`email` PK, `username`, bcrypt `password_hash`) |
| `sessions` | Auth tokens (`token` PK → `email`) |
| `reset_tokens` | Password reset tokens (`token` PK, `email`, `expires_at`) |
| `check_ins` | Career check-in data by `email` |
| `forum_posts` / `forum_replies` | Community forum posts and their replies |
| `shared_resumes` | Snapshot resumes behind `/r/:slug` share links (noindex, watermarked footer) |
| `personal_sites` | Pro personal websites at `/site/:name` (`subdomain` PK, indexable, watermark-free) |

Access is via prepared statements (`db.prepare(...).run/get/all`). Note: several older docs/comments still reference in-memory `Map` objects — that design has been replaced by the SQLite tables above.

## Auth flow

Sessions use UUID tokens stored in the browser's `localStorage` (`rt_token`, `rt_email`, `rt_username`). The server validates tokens via `GET /api/auth/me`. `app.html` forces the auth modal on load if no valid token exists.

Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (`bcryptjs`, per-record salt, `BCRYPT_ROUNDS=10`). Legacy accounts created before the migration used static-salt SHA-256 (`rta_salt_2026_` prefix); those hashes are still verified so nobody is locked out, and are transparently re-hashed to bcrypt on the user's next successful login (lazy migration — see `verifyPassword`/`isLegacyHash` in `server.js`). New signups and password resets always write bcrypt.

## Free tier gating

As of the 2026 pricing change, **the free tier is unlimited** for resume tailoring, cover letters, ATS scans, and LinkedIn optimizations — there is no per-day cap on those. Instead:

- **`/api/tailor` requires a signed-in account** (`getSessionEmail(req)` → 401 if absent) and is **IP rate-limited** (`tailorLimiter`, 20/min). An account, not a daily quota, is what guards the Anthropic API budget now.
- **Watermark**: non-subscribers' exports carry a small footer mark (DOCX `Footer` in `buildTemplatedDocxBuffer`, PDF print footer in `downloadPdf`, TXT trailer). Pro exports are clean. Gated by `isSubscriber(email)`.
- **Templates** are gated server-side (`FREE_TPL_SIGS`, see the table above).

The `usage_store` table still exists and is used for the remaining metered feature (`translate`, 1/day free; `video` is Pro-only). Legacy `hasFreeTierLeft`/`consumeFreeTier`/`getUsageKey` helpers remain for those. The `/api/status` endpoint still returns `freeXLeft` fields, but the client shows "Free — Unlimited Tailoring" rather than a remaining count.

## LinkedIn OAuth import (free)

Optional onboarding feature (`server.js`, routes `/api/auth/linkedin`, `/callback`, `/draft`, `/status`). Uses **"Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect"** (scope `openid profile email`) — official API, no scraping. Prefills the builder with name/email/photo (headline only if the app's granted scopes return it; standard OIDC does not expose full work history / education / skills, so the client scaffolds those and prompts the user to complete them). Hidden unless `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`/`LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` are set. CSRF `state` and one-time profile drafts are held in short-lived in-memory maps.

## Personal portfolio websites (Pro)

Pro users publish a resume as a live public page (`personal_sites` table; `POST/GET/DELETE /api/personal-site`, Pro-gated via `isSubscriber`). Rendered at **`/site/:name`** — indexable and **watermark-free** — by the shared `_shareResumeHtml(row, origin, opts)` renderer (also used by `/r/:slug` share links, which stay noindex and keep the brand footer). Subdomains are validated (3–30 chars, `RESERVED_SUBDOMAINS` blocklist); one site per user.

Path-based (`/site/:name`) is the current implementation. The intended end state is host-based `name.resumetailored.com` via a wildcard `*.resumetailored.com` DNS record + wildcard TLS and an early host-inspection middleware in `server.js`; that switch is deferred pending DNS/TLS provisioning (see `docs/RAILWAY_SETUP.md`).

## Stripe integration

- Checkout is initiated via `POST /api/subscribe` (monthly, `mode: subscription`) → returns a Stripe Checkout URL. `POST /api/subscribe-lifetime` (`mode: payment`, requires `STRIPE_LIFETIME_PRICE_ID`) handles the one-time lifetime plan.
- `POST /webhook` receives `checkout.session.completed` (inserts into the `subscribers` table) and `customer.subscription.deleted` (deletes by `customer_id`). Lifetime buyers are stored with a sentinel `customer_id` of `lifetime_${email}` so subscription-deletion events never remove them.
- The webhook route must use `express.raw()` body parsing (already set up) — do not add `express.json()` middleware before it.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must be set for webhook signature verification to pass.

## Email (optional)

Password reset emails and support contact messages are sent via Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY` env var). If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set, reset links and support messages are logged to stdout instead. The app functions fully without it.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Required for full functionality:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY     # Claude API
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY     # Stripe server-side
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY # Stripe client-side (used in public pages)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET # Stripe webhook signing secret
STRIPE_PRICE_ID       # Stripe Price ID for the monthly plan (price_...)
STRIPE_LIFETIME_PRICE_ID # optional — Price ID for the one-time lifetime plan
PORT                  # defaults to 3000
DATA_DIR              # optional — SQLite dir (default ./data; set /data + mount a Railway Volume to persist)
RESEND_API_KEY        # optional — enables real emails
OWNER_EMAIL           # optional — where support messages go (defaults to support@resumetailored.com)
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID     # optional — enables the free LinkedIn OAuth import button
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET # optional — pairs with LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI  # optional — defaults to <origin>/api/auth/linkedin/callback
```

## Deployment

Deployed on Railway. `railway.json` configures the build (a Debian `Dockerfile`) and start command. All env vars must be added in the Railway dashboard. The Stripe webhook endpoint URL is `https://<your-railway-url>/webhook`.

To switch from Stripe test mode to live mode: replace all three Stripe env vars with live keys and create a new product/price in Stripe live mode.

## Competitive Positioning (SEO & Growth)

### Core Value Props (use consistently across all landing pages and content)
- **AI Model**: Powered by Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6) — produces more natural, contextually rich writing than GPT-4 variants used by Teal, Kickresume, and most competitors
- **Free Tier**: unlimited free resume tailoring + cover letters, plus ATS scanner and LinkedIn optimizer/import — no credit card, no daily cap, forever (free account + small export watermark; premium templates, resume video and personal website are Pro)
- **Job URL Import**: Paste any LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, or 40+ job board URL — AI auto-extracts the full job description (no competitor offers this)
- **Bilingual**: Full English/Chinese UI + AI-powered translation for non-English resumes (unique in market)
- **Share as Link**: Turn any tailored resume into a private, unlisted web link (`/r/:slug`) that opens instantly in the browser — great for sending on LinkedIn or by email with no attachment/download
- **Pricing**: $19.99/mo (cheaper than Teal $29 and Jobscan ~$30) | $129 lifetime deal (vs Rezi $149)

### Competitor Intelligence
| Competitor | Monthly Traffic | Price | Key Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|
| Teal HQ (tealhq.com) | 2.81M/mo | $29/mo for AI | No AI resume rewriting on free tier; no cover letter |
| Jobscan (jobscan.co) | 2.05M/mo | ~$30/mo | Keyword SCORER only — does not rewrite resumes |
| Rezi (rezi.ai) | ~209K/mo | $29/mo or $149 LTD | GPT-based; weaker cover letter quality |
| Kickresume (kickresume.com) | Growing +15.8%/mo | $4.50/mo | GPT-4; two-column templates hurt ATS parse rate |
| Enhancv (enhancv.com) | ~297M/mo | $25/mo | Template SEO machine; hard to compete head-on |

### SEO Page Inventory
- `/alternatives/teal` → public/alternatives/teal.html
- `/alternatives/jobscan` → public/alternatives/jobscan.html
- `/alternatives/rezi` → public/alternatives/rezi.html
- `/teal-alternative` → public/teal-alternative.html (existing)

- `/tools/ats-keyword-extractor` → public/tools/ats-keyword-extractor.html (free tool, lead magnet)
- `/tools/resume-video` → public/tools/resume-video.html (free tool — embeds the in-browser `/preview` resume-video maker)
- `/resume-examples` → public/resume-examples.html (hub page targeting "resume examples" head term; internally links all 70 `*-resume.html` role pages grouped into 7 categories, plus a "By experience level" section linking the seniority variants. Role pages link back from their footers. `ItemList` + `BreadcrumbList` + `FAQPage` schema. Linked from homepage nav + footer.)
- `/cover-letter-examples` → public/cover-letter-examples.html (hub targeting "cover letter examples" head term; mirrors the resume hub for all 70 `*-cover-letter.html` role pages + seniority variants. Each role page has a role-specific sample opening + AI generator CTA and cross-links to its matching `*-resume` page. `ItemList` + `BreadcrumbList` + `FAQPage` schema.)
- `*-resume.html` / `*-cover-letter.html` → **70 base role pages** each, in 7 categories (Technology & Engineering, Business & Management, Finance & Sales, Healthcare & Education, Skilled Trades & Technical, Creative & Media, Hospitality & Service), served at `/{slug}-resume` and `/{slug}-cover-letter` via `express.static({ extensions: ['html'] })`.
- **Seniority variants**: `/{level}-{role}-resume` and `/{level}-{role}-cover-letter` where level ∈ `entry-level`/`senior`/`lead`, for 22 top roles = 66 variant pages each (132 total). Roles: tech + business (software-engineer, product-manager, project-manager, data-analyst, data-scientist, business-analyst, marketing-manager, web-developer, devops-engineer, ux-designer) and healthcare + finance + sales (registered-nurse, medical-assistant, nurse-practitioner, physical-therapist, pharmacist, accountant, financial-analyst, bookkeeper, financial-advisor, sales-representative, account-manager, sales-manager). Each has level-specific title/keywords/H1/FAQ/sample-opening (unique content so they rank separately from the base role) and a "By experience level" cross-link block to the base + sibling levels.
- All role/variant/hub pages (except the original 14 hand-authored `*-resume` pages) are generated from a single shared role dataset — see the generator scripts in git history — so counts, categories, cards and `ItemList` schema stay in sync. Adding roles or levels is a data edit.
- **Conversion CTA bar**: every example page (all `*-resume` / `*-cover-letter` pages + both hubs) loads `public/cta-bar.js` before `</body>` — a sticky, dismissible bottom bar (remembered in `localStorage`, GA `cta_bar_click` event) whose copy adapts to resume vs cover-letter by URL. Not shown on the homepage, blog, or app pages.
- `/blog/` → public/blog/index.html (blog index)

### Blog Content (public/blog/)
