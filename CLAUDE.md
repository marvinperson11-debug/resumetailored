# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

ResumeTailor AI is a SaaS product that uses Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6) to tailor resumes and generate cover letters from job postings. It charges $19/month via Stripe and offers 1 free tailoring/day on the free tier.

## Commands

```bash
npm install       # install dependencies
npm run dev       # run with nodemon (auto-restarts on file changes)
npm start         # run without nodemon (production)
```

There are no tests and no linter configured.

## Architecture

Everything lives in two places:

- **`server.js`** — the entire backend: Express app, all API routes, Stripe webhooks, Claude API calls, auth, file parsing, and .docx generation.
- **`public/`** — static frontend: `index.html` (landing page), `app.html` (main dashboard SPA), `style.css`, and post-payment pages.
- **`remotion/`** — the only TypeScript/React in the repo: a self-contained [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/docs) project that renders a tailored resume into a short MP4 (see "Resume video" below).

There is no build step for the web app. The frontend is plain HTML/CSS/JS with no framework. `app.html` is a single-page app where tabs are shown/hidden via `showTab()` without any routing. Remotion is the one exception — it has its own TSX compositions, compiled on demand by Remotion's own bundler (not by the web app).

## Resume video (Remotion)

A tailored resume can be turned into a short vertical MP4 (1080×1920, ~18s) for sharing on LinkedIn / Shorts / Reels. This is the only React/TypeScript in the codebase.

- **`remotion/`** — the Remotion project:
  - `index.ts` → `registerRoot`; `Root.tsx` declares the single `ResumeVideo` composition (duration derived from highlight count via `calculateMetadata`).
  - `ResumeVideo.tsx` + `scenes/` (`Background`, `Intro`, `Highlights`, `Skills`, `Outro`) — the animated scenes.
  - `data.js` — **CommonJS** single source of truth for default props + scene timing (`sceneFrames`), shared by both the TSX (via webpack CJS interop) and the Node server. `types.ts` holds only the `ResumeVideoProps` type.
  - `parseResume.js` — converts the plain-text tailor output into `ResumeVideoProps` (name, title, summary, top-5 highlights preferring quantified bullets, skills).
  - `render.js` — server-side renderer: `bundle()` once (cached) + `selectComposition()` + `renderMedia()`. Auto-detects a system `chromium` on PATH (or `REMOTION_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE`), else downloads Remotion's headless shell.
  - `narration.js` — voiceover for the MP4. `generateNarrationAsync` tries, in order: **ElevenLabs** (studio-quality, when `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set — uses the `/with-timestamps` endpoint for an mp3 + exact duration), then the local engine **Piper** (natural neural voice; Piper binary via `PIPER_BIN`/PATH/`python3 -m piper` + a voice model resolved from `PIPER_VOICE`/common dirs or best-effort downloaded), then **espeak-ng** (robotic), else silent. The script comes from `narrationScript` in `data.js`. `nixpacks.toml` installs Piper + the `en_US-lessac-medium` voice on Railway (guarded with `|| true`). The composition muxes the audio via `<Audio>` and extends to fit (`audioDurationInFrames`). The `/api/resume-video` route gates ElevenLabs to **subscribers** by default (`ELEVENLABS_FREE_TIER=on` opens it to all); `RESUME_VIDEO_VOICE=off` disables voice. Best-effort throughout: any failure ⇒ silent video, and the route retries silently if an audio render fails.
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/resume-video` (`server.js`) takes `{ resume, name?, accentColor?, email }`, gated like other features (subscribers unlimited; free tier = 1/day via the `video` usage key). It renders one video at a time (`videoRenderInFlight` lock → 429 if busy), streams the MP4, and deletes the temp file. The heavy Remotion packages are `require()`d lazily inside the handler, so the server boots even if they aren't installed (route returns 501).
- **Frontend**: a "🎬 Resume Video" button in `renderPreviewDownloadButtons()` (`app.html`, hidden for cover-letter-only mode) calls `downloadVideo()`.
- **Web preview (no server render)**: `public/preview.html` (served at `/preview`) plays the composition live in the browser via [`@remotion/player`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/player), loaded from esm.sh with React pinned through an import map — so it works on static hosting (Netlify deploy previews, mobile) with no Chromium. Supports **upload (PDF/DOCX/TXT, parsed client-side)** or paste, plus a voiceover synced to the player: a free **device voice** (Web Speech API, with a voice picker) or a **pro voice via ElevenLabs** (browser-direct — the user pastes their own API key, kept only in `localStorage` and sent only to ElevenLabs; no server key involved). Its scenes/parser/narration **mirror** the TSX + `data.js` in `remotion/` (kept deliberately in sync); the server-rendered MP4 remains the source of truth.
- **Local dev**: `npm run remotion:studio` (live preview/editor) and `npm run remotion:render` (CLI render to `out/`).
- **Deploy**: rendering needs Chromium + fonts. `nixpacks.toml` installs `chromium`, `fontconfig`, `dejavu_fonts`; the renderer auto-detects the binary. Rendering is CPU-heavy — keep the one-at-a-time lock.

## Persistent state (SQLite)

All server state is stored in a **SQLite database** (`better-sqlite3`) created in `server.js`. The DB file lives at `${DATA_DIR}/resumetailor.db` (`DATA_DIR` defaults to `./data`). For persistence across Railway deploys, set `DATA_DIR=/data` and mount a Railway Volume at `/data`; otherwise the DB is recreated in the ephemeral container on each deploy. WAL journaling is enabled.

Tables (all created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` at startup):

| Table | What it tracks |
|---|---|
| `usage_store` | Free-tier usage counts, keyed by `${ip}_${date}_${type}` (`count`); `type` ∈ `resume`, `cover_letter`, `translate`, `video`, … |
| `subscribers` | Active Stripe subscribers (`email` PK, `customer_id`) |
| `users` | User accounts (`email` PK, `username`, SHA-256 `password_hash`) |
| `sessions` | Auth tokens (`token` PK → `email`) |
| `reset_tokens` | Password reset tokens (`token` PK, `email`, `expires_at`) |
| `check_ins` | Career check-in data by `email` |
| `forum_posts` / `forum_replies` | Community forum posts and their replies |

Access is via prepared statements (`db.prepare(...).run/get/all`). Note: several older docs/comments still reference in-memory `Map` objects — that design has been replaced by the SQLite tables above.

## Auth flow

Sessions use UUID tokens stored in the browser's `localStorage` (`rt_token`, `rt_email`, `rt_username`). The server validates tokens via `GET /api/auth/me`. `app.html` forces the auth modal on load if no valid token exists.

Passwords are hashed with SHA-256 using a static salt (`rta_salt_2026_` prefix). This is not bcrypt — do not treat it as production-grade.

## Free tier gating

`/api/tailor` checks two things before calling Claude:
1. Is the `email` parameter in an active Stripe subscription? (`isSubscriber()`)
2. If not subscribed, has the IP used its free quota today? (`hasFreeTierLeft()`)

Free usage is tracked per-feature in the `usage_store` table, keyed by `${ip}_${date}_${type}` (e.g. `resume`, `cover_letter`). It resets naturally at midnight because the date string changes; old rows simply stop being read.

## Stripe integration

- Checkout is initiated via `POST /api/subscribe` (monthly, `mode: subscription`) → returns a Stripe Checkout URL. `POST /api/subscribe-lifetime` (`mode: payment`, requires `STRIPE_LIFETIME_PRICE_ID`) handles the one-time lifetime plan.
- `POST /webhook` receives `checkout.session.completed` (inserts into the `subscribers` table) and `customer.subscription.deleted` (deletes by `customer_id`). Lifetime buyers are stored with a sentinel `customer_id` of `lifetime_${email}` so subscription-deletion events never remove them.
- The webhook route must use `express.raw()` body parsing (already set up) — do not add `express.json()` middleware before it.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must be set for webhook signature verification to pass.

## Email (optional)

Password reset emails and support contact messages are sent via Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY` env var). If `RESEND_API_KEY` is not set, reset links and support messages are logged to stdout instead. The app functions fully without it.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Required for full functionality:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY     # Claude API
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY     # Stripe server-side
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY # Stripe client-side (used in public pages)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET # Stripe webhook signing secret
STRIPE_PRICE_ID       # Stripe Price ID for the monthly plan (price_...)
STRIPE_LIFETIME_PRICE_ID # optional — Price ID for the one-time lifetime plan
PORT                  # defaults to 3000
DATA_DIR              # optional — SQLite dir (default ./data; set /data + mount a Railway Volume to persist)
RESEND_API_KEY        # optional — enables real emails
OWNER_EMAIL           # optional — where support messages go (defaults to support@resumetailored.com)
```

## Deployment

Deployed on Railway. `railway.json` configures the build (Nixpacks) and start command. All env vars must be added in the Railway dashboard. The Stripe webhook endpoint URL is `https://<your-railway-url>/webhook`.

To switch from Stripe test mode to live mode: replace all three Stripe env vars with live keys and create a new product/price in Stripe live mode.

## Competitive Positioning (SEO & Growth)

### Core Value Props (use consistently across all landing pages and content)
- **AI Model**: Powered by Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6) — produces more natural, contextually rich writing than GPT-4 variants used by Teal, Kickresume, and most competitors
- **Free Tier**: 1 completely free, full resume tailoring + cover letter per day — no credit card, no time limit, forever
- **Job URL Import**: Paste any LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, or 40+ job board URL — AI auto-extracts the full job description (no competitor offers this)
- **Bilingual**: Full English/Chinese UI + AI-powered translation for non-English resumes (unique in market)
- **Pricing**: $19/mo (35% cheaper than Teal $29 and Jobscan ~$30) | $129 lifetime deal (vs Rezi $149)

### Competitor Intelligence
| Competitor | Monthly Traffic | Price | Key Weakness |
|---|---|---|---|
| Teal HQ (tealhq.com) | 2.81M/mo | $29/mo for AI | No AI resume rewriting on free tier; no cover letter |
| Jobscan (jobscan.co) | 2.05M/mo | ~$30/mo | Keyword SCORER only — does not rewrite resumes |
| Rezi (rezi.ai) | ~209K/mo | $29/mo or $149 LTD | GPT-based; weaker cover letter quality |
| Kickresume (kickresume.com) | Growing +15.8%/mo | $4.50/mo | GPT-4; two-column templates hurt ATS parse rate |
| Enhancv (enhancv.com) | ~297M/mo | $25/mo | Template SEO machine; hard to compete head-on |
